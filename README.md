# yii2-payum
Payum Module for Yii2

The goal is to make a working module for Yii2 that allows us to easily integrate Payum gateways with a custom Storage model.

Currently the module only allows you to add and configure Payum gateways (no custom storage integration. If someone wants to do this, please do!).
